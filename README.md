# dotfiles

This repository manages my personal configuration files ("dotfiles") for Unix-like systems. It includes settings for tools like Vim, Bash, Zsh, Tmux, Git, and more, designed to streamline development and system management.

## Requirements

Initial:
- **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):** An extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust.

Added by Setup Script:
- **ansible**, an automation tool used for configuration management
- **ruff**, a python linter and formatter that's presently replacing a whole suite of development tools
